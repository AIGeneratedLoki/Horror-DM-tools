D&D One-Shot Prompt: “Sanctuary of Shadows”
Tone & Style Overview
This one-shot is built for relentless horror: walls that whisper, townsfolk with secrets stitched under their skin, and never a truly safe place to rest. Every brief moment of comfort hides a new gut-twisting terror, riffing and winking at classic horror films while inventing its own nightmares.
Campaign Hook & Party Rationale
In a world where trust is as rare as sunlight and betrayal seeps into every stone, your party is a fragile miracle: a group of strangers united by desperation. Each of you has been plagued by the same recurring dream—a place of darkness, an impossible ritual, and a masked figure who whispers your name. You all carry a piece of a strange artifact, splattered with crimson, its use uncertain. When the nightmares lead you to the same crossroads at midnight, you have no choice but to work together, seeking answers, vengeance, or maybe just survival.
World Overview
This world is ruled by paranoia. Raiders, undead, wild animals, and killer cultists stalk the land. Towns hold the illusion of safety: street lamps flickering with suspicious regularity, guards who may be more interested in your valuables than your well-being.
Major Factions
The Shroud Cult: A fanatical group performing murderous rituals (“Wicker Man,” “Hereditary”).
The Martyred Guard: Armed lawmen more interested in their own survival than protecting others.
The Hollowed: Zombie-like beings haunted by memories, desperate for relief (“28 Days Later,” “Dawn of the Dead”).
The Man in the Mask (Main Antagonist): A supernatural slasher, faceless and silent, always closing in (“Halloween,” “Friday the 13th”).
Locations & Battle Maps
1. Black Hollow Village:
A rotting town surrounded by a ruined palisade. Stores with blood-stained counters, a church warped by black ivy, and flickering lamps that illuminate shadowy alleyways.
2. Mourning Fields Graveyard:
Crumbling mausoleums, toppled gravestones, holes that appear overnight, and the shifting shadows of the dead.
3. The Bleakwood:
A forest thicker than night, branches like claws. Paths always seem to double back. Home to monstrous animals and lost souls.
4. Saint’s End Chapel:
A church-turned-fortress, its stained glass painted with horror scenes. The basement is riddled with tunnels and forgotten relics.
5. Forsaken Market:
A bazaar filled with dangerous peddlers—some selling cursed items, others just waiting to rob the unwary.
6. The Catacombs Below:
A winding network of tunnels, inhabited by cultists and things best left undescribed.
Large Overworld Map: Six locations linked by tangled roads and treacherous shortcuts. Each spot features nooks for loot and ambushes.
NPCs & Factions (with References)
Maud Sallow, Shopkeeper: Looks harmless, but hoards weapons. Reference: Sweeney Todd.
Brother Aldritch: Priest at Saint’s End Chapel, secretly a cultist.
Holgar Vonn, Martyred Guard Captain: Wears battered armor, haunted by loss.
Gibbering Orphan: Cryptic child, offers clues in rhyme.
Mara the Rat-Keeper: Runs a black-market stall. Paranoid, heavily scarred.
The Man in the Mask: Moves silently, unkillable unless through a hidden ritual (think Michael Myers/Jason).
Each NPC has a unique stat block, motive, and possible betrayal.
Main Antagonist Mechanics
At the start of the DM’s turn, roll 1d6:
1-6 = one of the mapped locations. If the party and Mask are in the same spot, trigger a stealth skill check to hide—if failed, a terrifying slasher fight begins.
The Mask teleports, ignores barricades, and leaves cryptic bloody messages at each new site.
Quests & Adventure Hooks
Main Quest:
Gather three ritual components scattered among the locations:
The Crimson Censer: At the Forsaken Market, trapped behind a mimic merchant.
The Bone Knife: Hidden in a mausoleum, guarded by the Hollowed.
The Shroud’s Gospel: Buried in the labyrinthine catacombs, protected by cultists.
Gain ritual knowledge from deciphering clues, NPC dialogue, or stolen documents. Only by performing the ritual at Saint’s End Chapel can the Mask be made mortal.
Side Quests:
The Tall Man’s Debt: Recover stolen goods from a haunted farm outside Black Hollow; face a vengeful ghost.
Rat King’s Ransom: Get rare poison for Mara the Rat-Keeper in exchange for magical loot.
Dead Letters: Solve the secret of a talking head in the graveyard; reward is a scroll of “Speak with Dead” and lore about the ritual.
Loot & Magical Items
Important: Ritual components each have minor enchantments (e.g., Bone Knife deals extra psychic damage).
McGuffins: Cursed lockets, paintings that move, “protective” charms that do nothing but squeal when approached by the Mask.
Useful: Healing salves, spells in hidden books, daggers that drink light.
Imagery & Reference Suggestions
Describe gore in baroque, loving detail—blood that patterns like lacework, bone masks with weeping eyes, victim’s shadows burnt into the floor.
Linger on mundane items with sinister undertones—a child’s doll missing an eye, shop bells that echo after they should have stopped.
Prompt for AI or DMs
“Run a D&D 5e one-shot set in a world of relentless horror and paranoia, full of gore, references to classic horror movies, and vivid, unsettling imagery. Players are unlikely-but-allied travelers compelled by recurring nightmares and suggestive clues to gather ritual components and knowledge. The world features six distinct, terrifying locations connected by danger-ridden roads, populated with NPCs who may help, harm, or betray the party. Throughout the adventure, a supernatural slasher—The Man in the Mask—hunts the party, with the threat of a deadly encounter always present. Build in horror movie references, side quests with memorable mini bosses, terrifying magical items (real and fake), and detailed, battle-ready maps of each area. Trust no one, and reveal nothing is ever truly safe.”

Absolutely! Here are richer location descriptions and custom visual prompts for creating vivid, horror-inspired top-down battle maps for each distinct area in your game.
1. Black Hollow Village
Detailed Description:
Black Hollow Village is decaying from the inside out. Its skeletal wooden palisade, splintered and overgrown with choking weeds, surrounds uneven cobbled streets slick with mud and old blood. Half-collapsed houses groan in the night wind. Shop windows are smeared crimson, their insides cluttered with shelves of expired, sometimes sinister wares—rusted weapons, bottles of suspicious tinctures, and trinkets that twitch when no one is looking. In the crooked plaza, a fountain spills murky water, and the air perpetually smells of mildew and rot. The church at the village’s heart is strangled by black ivy, with warped doors and shattered stained-glass that casts blood-colored light into the street. Lanterns flicker erratically, casting long, shuddering shadows that disguise alleyways twisting out of sight—perfect for both ambushes and secret stashes.
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down view of a decrepit medieval village surrounded by a broken wooden palisade, muddy cobblestone roads, crumbling and overgrown houses, a blood-stained shop, a twisted church overrun by black ivy, dim flickering lanterns, and ominous alleyways. Add scattered debris, broken carts, and patches of wild weeds.
2. Mourning Fields Graveyard
Detailed Description:
This graveyard sprawls far beyond a basic plot, stretching into a desolation of crooked tombstones and yawning sepulchers. Stone mausoleums are caked in moss, with doors forced open or toppled entirely. Some graves have collapsed into aching pits, fresh earth heaped beside them, as if something clawed its way out—perhaps recently. An ancient, leafless tree looms at the center, its roots upending the ground and creating new, unsettling hollows. Flickers of ghostly light hover over some markers at night, and distorted shadows slither just out of sight. The rows of graves are uneven, some adorned with trinkets left by mourners, others splintered or scorched. The air is heavy with the scent of damp soil and decay.
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down map of a sprawling, ancient graveyard: crooked graves, collapsed mausoleums, open earth pits, a central gnarled tree, scattered trinkets, patches of fog, and flickering will-o’-wisps. Paths are uneven, bordered by moss and tall, black iron fences.
3. The Bleakwood
Detailed Description:
An unnatural forest, thicker and darker than it ought to be, where tangled roots and grasping branches block the sun even at midday. Trails loop confusingly, so those who enter feel watched by unseen eyes—sometimes their own. The ground is soft and treacherous, occasionally giving way to shallow graves or animal dens. In places, old wooden effigies hang from the trees, some shivering in the wind. Strange bone charms and blood-soaked ribbons mark claimed territory. Every sound is muffled, save for the rare and sudden snap of a twig, hinting at monstrous predators or lost souls that skulk between trunks.
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down of an overgrown, foreboding forest: dense, twisting paths, claw-like branches, scattered animal dens, ritual effigies, hanging bone charms, tattered ribbons, mists clinging to the ground, and sporadic shallow graves.
4. Saint’s End Chapel
Detailed Description:
Once holy, now profane: Saint’s End Chapel looms behind high walls and spiked gates, its facade pitted by fire and time. Multicolored stained-glass windows, now warped and bloodied, depict scenes of suffering and unholy rites. The nave holds overturned pews, broken altars, and sigils carved into the stone. Spiral stairways descend beneath trapdoors to torchlit tunnels that wind through the earth, where heretical texts and ossuaries lay hidden among the dust. Echoes here are too loud, and the cold is unnatural—some swear they hear prayers muttered by disembodied voices.
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down view of a ruined stone chapel with gothic, stained-glass windows, battered doors, blood-streaked halls, rubble-strewn pews, hidden trapdoors revealing winding underground tunnels, ossuaries, and flickering wall torches.
5. Forsaken Market
Detailed Description:
The market’s canvas awnings are ripped and sagging, their colors faded and stained. Cramped stalls packed with dubious goods cluster in uneven rows: jars of black oil, knives with rusty etchings, and forbidden tomes. Many stalls are empty or barricaded, and some are fake fronts for pit traps or thieves’ dens below—the wood beneath your feet creaks ominously. Vendors hiss invitations, some offering rare trinkets while others size up coin purses. “Guards” loiter but are often complicit in theft. The smell of rot and burnt spices floats on the air.
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down of a shadowy bazaar with torn and drooping awnings, haphazard vendor stalls, piles of strange goods, scattered crates, obvious and hidden trapdoors, winding alley market routes, and dubious characters lurking in corners.
6. The Catacombs Below
Detailed Description:
A labyrinthine network of tunnels hewn into ancient stone. Moisture drips from the arched ceilings; cryptic murals are scrawled on the walls in old blood. Some passages open into rooms piled with skulls and ossuary cages, others are blocked by collapsed rubble or guarded by rickety doors. The scent of mold, death, and candle wax saturates the air. Faint chanting sometimes echoes from unseen cultist gatherings, punctuated by the scurrying of unseen vermin. Torches flicker, sometimes with unnatural colors.
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down inky-dark dungeon plan: snaking corridors, tiny burial cells, bone piles, flickering torches, blocked passages, ritual circles, secret alcoves, and the occasional flicker of otherworldly light on damp, ancient stone.
Large Overworld Map
Description:
Six key locations are sprawled across a withered landscape. Twisting dirt roads connect ruined towns, graveyards, dark forests, chapels, markets, and catacombs. The spaces between teem with hazards—overgrown fields, broken bridges, and quick ambush points. Lonely signposts tilt at odd angles and fog blankets low-lying areas. Shortcuts exist for the brave or desperate, but who knows what lurks there?
Map Generation Prompt:
Top-down overworld map: six distinct horror-themed icons representing village, graveyard, forest, chapel, market, and catacombs arranged across a gloomy landscape, tangled dirt roads (some cracked or overgrown), shadowy woods, fog patches, scattered debris, and ambush points between major locations.
